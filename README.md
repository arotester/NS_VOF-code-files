# NS_VOF-code-files
The files involve the important header/function files used in the main code that solves the two-phase jet flow problem. These files involve the Navier-Stokes solver file which is coupled with the Volume-of-Fluid solver file. 

1) BC.h==> This is the header file containg boundary conditions for the main file
2) VOF.h==> This file contains the Volume-of-Fluid solver used to simulate the multiphase flows.
3) NS_solver.h==> This header file contains the Navier-Stokes solver based on the Semi-Explicit methodology.
